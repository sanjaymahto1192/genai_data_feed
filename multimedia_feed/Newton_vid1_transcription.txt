 The market continues to be dominated by the outlook for inflation and subsequent central bank decisions. Inflation has been more persistent than originally expected, with the first rate cuts having been pushed out from March to June. We've started to see some divergence too in headline data numbers by region, with the US economy seemingly hotter than the UK and Europe. This could in time lead to some variance in returns, but for now the market remains buoyant that we can tolerate this higher inflation for longer and still reach us off landing. For us, given these macro dynamics are so hard to predict, we choose to take a more bottom up approach, looking at companies and their respective growth drivers on a stock specific basis. For example, we've seen an opportunity to add to our consumer staples' exposure, as these more steady revenue-generating companies were left behind on the risk rally at the start of the year. We believe their strong brand equity and the resilience of their earnings, coupled with some stock specific internal improvement strategies for some, will see these players fare well if we enter a period of slower growth. We also continue to light pockets of the industrial space. The ever-growing need for automisation against a backdrop of labour shortages and inflation, as well as pressure to reduce our energy consumption, are all supportive tailwinds to some companies in this space. It's taken much longer than expected for supply chains to normalise, but increasingly it feels like visibility is getting better here, while these tailwinds should still persist.
